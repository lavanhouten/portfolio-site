                                    Introduction
                                </h2>
								<p>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to analyze the crime rates and how they differ from place to place throughout
								the city of Detroit in 2021, first we needed to stratify the data by our two subdivisions of
								the city: zip code and neighborhood. This was done by counting the number of crimes
								by the given zip code value and neighborhood value for each crime. Then we displayed
								these values on a map, with red representing high crime and green representing low. In
								order to see if more robberies occurred near grocery stores specifically, we used a
								dataset of all the locations of grocery stores in the city and used st_buffer to find all of
								the crimes that occurred within a 0.5 mile radius and within a 1 mile radius. This allowed
								us to analyze the crime rate around grocery stores specifically.
								</p>
								<h2>
                                    Crime Location Findings
                                </h2>
								<p>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the beginning, it was defined that high rates of crime consisted of more than 1200
								crimes in a neighborhood in 2021 and more than 5000 crimes in a given zip code. Low
								rates of crime consisted of less than 100 crimes in a given neighborhood and less than
								100 crimes in a zip code. Using these parameters as guidance, it was found that there
								were certain areas of the city that had distinctly higher rates of crime by these
								standards, specifically the far eastern and far western portions of the city. Zip codes like
								48228 and 48224 had the highest rates of crime throughout the city. The neighborhoods
								with the lowest rates of crime were generally located in the south and in a ring around
								the center of the city. Examples of neighborhoods located in those areas were Belle Isle
								and Carbon Works. These findings indicate a difference in police coverage and
								potentially economic welfare. It is known locally that the outer reaches of Detroit are the
								most dangerous and are also the most impoverished, which is supported by this data.
								</p>
								<h2>
                                    Grocery Store Robbery Findings
                                </h2>
								<p>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When analyzing whether or not more robberies occurred near grocery stores, we
								created buffers around each grocery store in Detroit and mapped them. These buffers
								had radii of 0.5 and 1 mile. This enabled me to count the number of robberies that
								occurred nearby to grocery stores at two different levels and compare them.								
								</p>
								<p>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The area of a circle with a radius half the size of another circle is 1/4th the size of
								the larger circle. Thus, if the presence of the grocery store is indicative of more
								opportunities for robbery, the mean amount of robberies in the 0.5 radius buffer should
								be larger than ¼ th the mean amount of robberies in the larger radius. The mean for the
								0.5 mile circle is 9.622 and the 1 mile circle is 29.81. This indicates that the amount of
								robberies that occur closer to grocery stores is higher than the amount of robberies that
								occur elsewhere. As expected, there is a higher spread in the IQR and standard
								deviation of the number of crimes that occur in a 1 mile radius when compared to the
								0.5 mile radius, as there is higher variance in the potential areas within such a larger
								radius circle. All this makes sense as grocery stores are obvious targets for robberies as
								they offer a large variety of essential goods, offering things that desperate people would
								be willing to rob in order to survive. Thus, the observation that more robberies occur in
								their areas makes sense.								
								</p>

									Conclusions
                                </h2>
								<p>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To create this report, I manipulated geospatial data on crimes, neighborhoods, zip
								codes, and grocery stores in Detroit, Michigan in order to investigate the location and
								nature of crimes within the city. Using neighborhood and zip code data associated with
								each crime, I was able to discover which zip codes and neighborhoods were the most
								crime ridden and which were the safest. The most dangerous zip codes were located on
								the edges of the city whereas the safest zip codes were located in a ring around the
								center of the city. Using the location of robberies throughout the city and the location of
								grocery stores, I was able to investigate whether or not robberies were more likely to
								occur in areas where grocery stores were located. There were more robberies in the
								areas where grocery stores were. I noticed that the data for the locations of crimes
								could be derived from the location of each crime given by coordinates and by the given
								zip code and neighborhood associated with each crime. This could potentially cause
								some variance in the interpretation of the data if these don’t line up, but I used the given
								zip code and neighborhood associated with each crime.
