                                    Introduction
                                </h2>
								<p>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using census data, I used statsmodels and scikit learn to predict which income
								class an individual is a part of, >50k or <=50k. Other packages that were used include
								pandas, numpy, seaborn, and matplotlib. The dataset contains data points about each
								individual including education level, working class, marital status, occupation,
								relationship status, race, sex, capital gain, capital loss, hours worked per week, native
								country, and age.
								</p>
								<h2>
                                    Exploratory Analysis
                                </h2>
								<p>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I began the exploratory process of deciding which data points would be most
								valuable to use in modeling by breaking down which of the data points in the dataset
								would be the most impactful for having a high income, and I determined three important
								determining factors would be age, hours worked per week, and education level. Then I
								investigated and found my intuition to be true according to the data; the mean age of
								people in the higher income class was high, the mean amount of hours worked per
								week in the higher income class was higher, and the mean education level of people in
								the higher income class was also higher.
								</p>
								<h2>
                                    Predictive Modelling
                                </h2>
								<p>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I created a statsmodels logistic regression model and found that: For an
								increase in the age of a person by 1, the odds that the person earns more than 50k is
								1.048028 times as large as the odds that they do not earn more than 50k. For an
								increase in the hours worked per week of a person by 1, the odds that the person earns
								more than 50k is 1.043762 times as large as the odds that they do not earn more than
								50k. For an increase in the education level of a person by 1, where Preschool
								completion is a value of 1 and a Doctorate degree is a value of 16, the odds that the
								person earns more than 50k is 1.412505 times as large as the odds that they do not
								earn more than 50k.
								</p>
								<p>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to test the predictive ability of these data points, I created a scikit learn
								model with the same data points where I separated the data into training and testing
								datasets with 80% of the data in the training dataset and 20% in the testing dataset. The
								real odds of each variable in this model, trained with 80% of the original data, were
								essentially the same as the real odds of each variable in the statsmodels model from
								above. Using education level number, age, and hours worked per week as explanatory
								variables, this model was 78.78% accurate in predicting the chances that an individual
								earns more than 50k per year or not. Its precision was 61.58%, recall score was 30%,
								and F1 score was 40.38%. These results indicated to me that the model was failing to
								accurately predict positive values, those that earn more than 50k. Combined with
								analysis of a confusion matrix of the results of the model, it appeared that it was over
								predicting the number of people who earn less than or equal to 50k and predicting very
								few of the inputs to earn more than 50k at all. The cause of this sort of overprediction
								could be due to the fact that far more of the training data points earned less than or
								equal to 50k rather than more. This observation is further reflected in the accuracy
								score that is much higher than the precision, recall, and F1 scores due to the fact that it
								is heavily influenced positively by the high number of true negative predictions. This
								issue could be fixed by training the model on a dataset more evenly split between the
								income classes of >50k and <=50k resulting in a model that takes into account the 50k.

                                    Conclusions
                                </h2>
								<p>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using both statsmodels and sklearn, I created a model that predicts whether or
								not an individual earns more than 50k or not. This was done through an exploratory
								data analysis stage where I determined that education level, age, and hours worked per
								week were the features that were the most impactful of those available, so I created a
								statsmodels model with them and found the real odds coefficients for each variable.
								Then I made a sklearn model with the same explanatory variables that I trained and
								tested, finding that the model predicted a lot of false negatives due to the fact that a lot
								of the training data had a lot more data points that had an income class of less than or
								equal to 50k. In the end, the model was relatively accurate but could be improved by
								different training data and possibly different explanatory variables.
