								<p>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an investigation into an imbalanced dataset of Adults and Seniors 
								where, using a Random Forest Classifier and Multilayer Perceptrons, I was able to predict whether or not
								an individual was an Adult or a Senior based on health data from the National Health and Nutrition Health Survey 
								2013-2014 (NHANES) Age Prediction Subset. I also investigated which health statistics were the most predictive 
								of whether an individual was an Adult or a Senior.
								</p>
								<p>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dataset was heavily imbalanced, with the number of Adults far outnumbering the 
								Seniors. This forced me to take a different approach than usual when working with this dataset, making sure that the 
								classes were weighted equally in order to reduce the bias of the model and paying attention to different metrics than usual. 
								I also believe there is a lot more work to be done here with different models and feature engineering that could further improve the results.
